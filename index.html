    <h4>The "developer in training"</h4>
    <p id="introPara">
      I was always decently successful in school, but never had the drive to make sure I did well enough for college. I wasn't good at doing the homework on time, and always skimmed by with good test scores. After high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went to Kirkwood for a year and a half, trying to figure that out. Still not having a clue, I decided to just go back into working for a while, then found DeltaV Code School. From there, I've been doing my best to figure stuff out with them, and I am finally on the path to becoming a software developer.

    <h3>What is this page for?</h3>
      <p id="infoPara">
        This page is here to introduce myself as a coding student, as well as a future developer. I hope to build on this page to introduce my goals, things I like, things I do in my life, as well as whatever else I can think of putting on here. I look forward to my future in DeltaV, as well as my future with software development.
