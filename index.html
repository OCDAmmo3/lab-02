      <p>
        I was always decently successful in school, but never had the drive to make sure I did well enough for college. I wasn't good at doing the homework on time, and always skimmed by with good test scores. After high school, I didn't know what I wanted to do, so I went to Kirkwood for a year and a half, trying to figure that out. Still not having a clue, I decided to just go back into working for a while, then found DeltaV Code School. From there, I've been doing my best to figure stuff out with them, and I am finally on the path to becoming a software developer. <br />
        <br />
        As a student and eventual developer, I want to learn as much as possible to overload myself, and then do my best to sort all that information out and let myself soak it in and implement into my work.

      <h3>What is this page for?</h3>
        <p>
          This page is here to introduce myself as a coding student, as well as a future developer. I hope to build on this page to introduce my goals, things I like, things I do in my life, as well as whatever else I can think of putting on here. I look forward to my future in DeltaV, as well as my future with software development.
